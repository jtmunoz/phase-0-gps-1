Prior to this GPS session I was struggling with push, pull, pull requests.
During the session Assunta helped in my understanding of the Github process.
I remember getting stuck at one point and Lorena helped in clarifying but I can't remember what it was.
The GitHub workflow is still a bit confusing. I just have to get used working with it. The more I am actually doing it the easier it becomes.
I really liked the GPS session. It is nice because there is person with experience that offers guidance while staying hands off. It gives us the opportunity workout any errors on our own and, when the time comes, is right there for us.
