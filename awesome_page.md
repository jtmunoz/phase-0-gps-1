# Presidential Roosevelt the Programmer #

**Theodore Roosevelt**

> Speak softly, and carry a big stick.

I believe if President Roosevelt was a coder he would have been a big fan of the `rm -rf` command and probably `rmdir`

He might have even had some command of his own: 
```
git speak softly 
git carry big stick
```

His terminal might have looke something like this [Presidential Command](https://github.com/jtmunoz/phase-0-gps-1/blob/master/screenshot.png).

I think he might might have liked to order pizza late an night. His order might have looked like this:

- One extra **large** pizza
 
  * *soft* pretzel crust
  
  * ~~white sauce~~ **GREAT WHITE Sauce**

  * Extra **_Bull Moose_** sausage
