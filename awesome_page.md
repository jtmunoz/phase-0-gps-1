# Presidential Roosevelt the Programmer
**Theodore Roosevelt**
> Speak softly, and carry a big stick.
I believe if President Roosevelt was a coder he would be a big fan of the 'rm -rf' command and probably 'rmdir'
He might have even had some command of his own:
'''
git speak softly
git carry big stick
'''
His terminal might have looke something like this [Presidential Command](https://github.com/jtmunoz/phase-0-gps-1/blob/master/screenshot.png).
I think he might might have liked to order pizza late an night. His order might have looked like this:
- One extra **large** pizza
  - *soft* pretzel crust
  -~~white sauce~~ **GREAT WHITE Sauce**
  -Extra **_Bull Moose_** sausage
