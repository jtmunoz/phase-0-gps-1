#Reflection on GSP 1.1

##What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggeling with push and pull on git-hub

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Going through the GitHub process together with Jordan helped me get more comfortable with the workflow.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I cannot remember what questions exactly I asked. One question I remeber was on the syntax. Whether we have to use capital letters if the file name is in campital letters.

##What still confuses you about Git?

What still confuses me are the variety of steps to take. Sometimes the workflow functions if I forget something othertimes it doesn. But I guess it needs more practice.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I did not know what to expect, but I really liked it. Having somebody experienced watch silently and checking if we do everything right was very comforting.
